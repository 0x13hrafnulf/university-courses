Information Security course

Repository was created for the course project. 
Simple port scan detector from the input pcap file. 
Might restructure current code to add a possibility to run online mode.

UPDATE: There is a problem with the memory leak due to bad data structure design, have to redo design or might start doing it over again from the scratch but for both online and offline implementations.
