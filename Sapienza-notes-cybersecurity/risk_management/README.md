## Theory

### Introduction. The ISO 27000 family of standards

- What is a risk
  - Risk: effect of uncertainty on objectives (ISO 31000)
  - Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) has a broader scope (beyond cyber risks): risk management in agencies
  - Risk management: process of identifying, monitoring and managing potential risks in order to minimize the negative impact they may have on an organization. Examples of potential risks include security breaches, data loss, cyber attacks, system failures and natural disasters. An effective risk management process will help identify which risks pose the biggest threat to an organization and provide guidelines for handling them at the best level of resources
    - Parts
      - Risk assessment and analysis (depends on the company): evaluates an organization's exposure to uncertain events that could impact its day to day operations and estimates the damage those events could have on an organization's revenue and reputation
        - Probability vs Impact

          ![](./res/img/1.png)

      - Risk evaluation (how company faces the risk): compares estimated risks against risk criteria that the organization has already established. Risk criteria can include associated costs and benefits socio economic factors legal requirements and system malfunctions
      - Risk treatment (how company handles risk): implementation of policies and procedures that will help avoid or minimize risks Risk treatment also extends to risk transfer and risk financing
        - Actions that can be taken
          - Avoid risk
          - Minimize risk
          - Transfer risk
          - Accept risk
    - Risk evolution

### The ISO 27005 standard for management of information technology risks

- Used to make risk assessment (Identification, Analysis and Evaluation) in organizations
- Risk assessment
  - Why?

    ![](./res/img/6.png)

    - Fastest way to gain a complete understanding of an organization's security profile; its strengths and weaknesses, its vulnerabilities and exposures
    - You must measure to manage
  - Very complicated to do
  - Definitions
    - Risk: effect of uncertainty on objectives
    - Threat: potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or organization
    - Vulnerability: weakness of an asset or control that can be exploited by one or more threats
    - Control: measure that is modifying risk
  - ISO 27005: Information Security Risk Management guideline
    - Provides a RA guideline and does not recommend any RA methodologies
    - Applicable to organizations of all types
    - Benefits
      - Risks being identified
      - Risks being assessed in terms of their consequences to the business and the likelihood of their occurrence
      - The likelihood and consequences of these risks being communicated and understood
      - Priority order for risk treatment being established
      - Priority for actions to reduce risks occurring
      - Stakeholders being involved when risk management decisions are made and kept informed of the risk management status
      - Effectiveness of risk treatment monitoring: are we aware?
      - Risks and the risk management process being monitored and reviewed regularly
      - Information being captured to improve the risk management approach
      - Managers and staff being educated about the risks and the actions taken to mitigate them
    - Approach
      - Depending on the scope and objectives of the risk management different approaches can be applied
      - An appropriate risk management approach should be selected or developed that addresses basic criteria such as risk evaluation criteria, impact criteria, risk acceptance criteria
        - Risk acceptance criteria: depend on the organization's policies goals objectives and the interests of stakeholders
          - Can include multiple thresholds with a desired target level of risk but provision for senior managers to accept risks above this level under defined circumstances
          - Can be expressed as the ratio of estimated profit or other business benefit to the estimated risk different
          - Can apply to different classes of risk
          - Can include requirements for future additional treatment (e.g. a risk can be accepted if there is approval and commitment to take action to reduce it to an acceptable level within a defined time period)
          - Can differ according to how long the risk is expected to exist (e.g. risk can be associated with a temporary or short term activity)
          - Should be setup considering Risk appetite
            - Business criteria
            - Operations
            - Technology
            - Finance
            - Social and humanitarian factors
      - The organization should assess whether necessary resources are available to
        - Perform risk assessment and establish a risk treatment plan
        - Define and implement policies and procedures including implementation of the controls selected
        - Monitor controls and monitor the information security risk management process
    - Organization: should be approved by the appropriate managers of the organization
      - Development of the information security risk management process suitable for the organization
      - Identification and analysis of the stakeholders
      - Definition of roles and responsibilities of all parties both internal and external
      - Establishment of the required relationships between the organization and stakeholders as well as interfaces to the organization's high level risk management functions (e.g. operational risk management) as well as interfaces to other relevant projects or activities
      - Definition of decision escalation paths
      - Specification of records to be kept
    - Methodologies
      - Qualitative: uses a scale of qualifying attributes to describe the magnitude of potential consequences (low medium and high) and the likelihood that those consequences will occur
        - Pros and cons
          - Advantage: ease of understanding by all relevant personnel 
          - Disadvantage: is the dependence on subjective choice of the scale
        - These scales can be adapted or adjusted to suit the circumstances and different descriptions can be used for different risks
        - Usage
          - As an initial screening activity to identify risks that require more detailed analysis
          - Where this kind of analysis is appropriate for decisions where the numerical data or resources are inadequate for a quantitative risk analysis
      - Quantitative: uses a scale with numerical values for both consequences and likelihood
        - Uses historical incident data
          - Pros and cons
            - Advantage: can be related directly to the information security objectives and concerns of the organization
            - Disadvantage
              - Lack of such data on new risks or information security weaknesses
              - Auditable data is not available thus creating an illusion of worth and accuracy of the risk assessment
        - Formulas

          ![](./res/img/22.png)

          - Legend

            ![](./res/img/23.png)

          - Acceptance threshold
            - All risks that fall under a pre-established NRV (threshold) are acceptable and can be retained
            - The threshold is modifiable/ied by management during the process of repetition/continuous improvement
          - Levels (risk categories)

            ![](./res/img/24.png)

    - Workflow

      ![](./res/img/7.png)

      - Information Security Risk Assessment = Risk Analysis + Risk Evaluation
        - Risk Analysis = Risk Identification + Risk Estimation
          - Risk Identification: risk characterized in terms of organizational conditions
            - Identification of Assets
            - Identification of Threats
          - Risk Estimation: specifies the measure of risk
            - Qualitative

      - Risk treatment

        ![](./res/img/25.png)

        - Modification (mitigation): handling the risk
        - Acceptance/retention: accept that nothing can be done (the risk owner decides, take care of consequences)
        - Avoidance: decide to do nothing (if the risk of going as a tourist in Siria then you don't go)
        - Sharing/transfer: insurance
      - Risk communication
        - Provide assurance of the outcome of the organizationâ€™s risk management
