## Description

This repo is the copy of the https://gitlab.com/myasnik/sapienza-notes-cybersecurity which is maintained by my friend and groupmate https://gitlab.com/myasnik. All rights belong to Pietro Mazzini. 

## Disclaimer

This is a reorganization and redigitalization work more than a summary.

The stuff in this repo is based on professors' slides; there could be typing or concept errors in my summaries so keep an eye open.
